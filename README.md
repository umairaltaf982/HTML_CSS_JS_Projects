# Question no.01:
## Unique Product Card Design:
### Objective:
Design and implement a visually unique product card using only CSS and JavaScript. The product card should feature a 3D flip animation, where the front side displays basic product details, and the back side reveals additional information when hovered.
### Requirements:
* The product card must have a front and back side. When hovered, the card should perform a smooth 3D flip to reveal the back side. The transition should be animated using only CSS (no JavaScript-based animations).
* The card content must be structured using CSS Grid. There should be proper alignment of text, images, and buttons within the grid.
* Product details should be fetched from a JavaScript object instead of hardcoded HTML. The object should contain multiple products, and the JavaScript code should dynamically create the product cards.
* The front side should display product name, price, and image. The back side should display a short product description.
### Constraints:
* No frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, or jQuery.
### Bonus:
* Add a "Buy Now" button that logs the selected product's name to the console when clicked.
* Implement a dark mode toggle for the product cards.








# Question no.02:
## Interactive To-Do List with Priority Management:
### Objective:
Develop an interactive to-do list where users can add, delete, and prioritize tasks dynamically. The tasks should be categorized by priority levels, and users should be able to mark tasks as completed, moving them to a separate section. The
implementation should use arrays, map(), reduce(), event delegation, and DOM manipulation.

### Requirements:
* Users can add tasks with a name and a priority level (High, Medium, Low).
* Tasks should be displayed dynamically using map() and grouped by priority.
* Each task should have a "Complete" button to move it to the completed list.
* Clicking "Delete" should remove a task from the list.
* Use reduce() to display the total number of incomplete tasks.
### Constraints:
* Vanilla JavaScript only (no external libraries).
* Use event delegation for button clicks instead of multiple event listeners.
* The app should dynamically update the UI without requiring a page refresh.
* Prevent adding empty tasks and ensure UI updates correctly when tasks are completed or deleted.
### Bonus:
* Search & Filter to find tasks by name or priority.
* Dark Mode toggle.







# Question no.03:
## Selective String Reversal with Dynamic List Population:
### Objective:
Develop an interactive web-based tool that processes a user-inputted string by reversing it while skipping characters at specific intervals. The skip interval is determined by summing the digits of your roll number. The transformed result should be displayed dynamically on the webpage.
### Requirements:
* Create an HTML form with fields for a string and a roll number, plus a "Transform"
button.
* Extract digits from the roll number and compute their sum to determine the skip interval (N).
* Reverse the string while skipping every N-th character, preserving their original
positions.
* Display the original and transformed strings in a dynamically updated list using
DOM manipulation.
* Implement logic using arrow functions, map(), reduce(), sets, and JavaScript
functions.
### Constraints:
* Handle edge cases like N > string length.
* Maintain correct positioning of spaces.
* Use only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
### Bonus:
* Allow users to manually enter a skip interval instead of using the roll number sum.






# Question no.04:
## Bank Account System:
### Objective:
Develop a bank account simulation where the account number and initial deposit are dynamically generated based on the studentâ€™s roll number. The system should support deposits, withdrawals, and transaction tracking while enforcing financial constraints.
### Requirements:
* Generate a unique account number using the roll number.
* Set the initial deposit as the last digit of the roll number multiplied by 1000 PKR.
* Implement deposit and withdrawal functions with form inputs.
* Ensure the deposit is always the multiple of your roll number only.
* Use reduce () to calculate the total balance from transaction history.
* Display transaction history dynamically using DOM manipulation.
### Constraints:
* Withdrawals are limited to 80% of the current balance.
* Use only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Implement logic using arrow functions, arrays, map(), reduce(), set, and JavaScript built-in functions.
### Bonus:
* Provide an option to download transaction history as a .txt file.






# Question no.05:
## Roll-Number based Discount System:
### Objective:
Develop an e-commerce discount system where students enter their roll number to get a dynamically generated discount on a product. The roll number determines the discount percentage, and the final price is calculated in real time.
### Requirements:
* Extract the middle two digits of the roll number to determine the discount percentage (e.g., if the roll number is 21F-9445, the discount is 44%).
* Display a list of products with prices and allow the student to select one.
* Calculate and show the discounted price dynamically using DOM manipulation.
* Use reduce() to apply multiple discounts if a student selects more than one
product.
* Ensure real-time price updates when the student enters their roll number.
### Constraints:
* The maximum discount is 50%, even if the roll number suggests more.
* Implement logic using arrays, map(), reduce(), set, and arrow functions.
* The UI must update instantly without a page reload.
* Use only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
### Bonus:
* Allow students to enter an additional promo code for extra discounts.
* Increase max discounts to 60% after 2 purchases.
